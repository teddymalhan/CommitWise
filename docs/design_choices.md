# Software Design Choices

## Overview

This document outlines the key software design choices made during the development of **CommitWise**. These decisions were guided by industry best practices, scalability requirements, and the need to integrate with cloud-based services. The goal is to create a robust, maintainable, and scalable application architecture that leverages both custom implementations and AWS cloud services.

## 1. **Architecture Style: Microservices**

### Rationale
- **Scalability**: Microservices allow individual components of the application to scale independently, ensuring that performance bottlenecks in one service do not affect the entire system.
- **Maintainability**: By decoupling services, each microservice can be developed, tested, and deployed independently, making the system easier to maintain and evolve.
- **Flexibility**: Different services can be built using the most appropriate technologies for their specific tasks, improving efficiency and performance.

### Components
- **Commit Getter Service**: Fetches commit data from GitHub.
- **Diff Parser Service**: Parses commit diffs to extract relevant changes.
- **AI Explanation Service**: Generates AI-based explanations for code changes.
- **Tutorial Management Service**: Manages the creation and storage of interactive tutorials.
- **User Management Service**: Handles user authentication and profile management.
- **API Gateway**: Centralizes API management, routing, and security.

## 2. **Design Pattern: MVC (Model-View-Controller)**

### Rationale
- **Separation of Concerns**: MVC separates the application logic into distinct layers (Model, View, Controller), making the codebase more organized and easier to manage.
- **Reusability**: By decoupling data handling (Model), user interaction (View), and request handling (Controller), components can be reused across different parts of the application.
- **Testability**: MVC architecture enhances testability by allowing individual components to be tested in isolation.

### Implementation
- **Model**: Represents the application's data and business logic (e.g., commit data, parsed diffs, user profiles).
- **View**: Although traditional "views" are handled in the frontend, the backend "views" consist of the API responses returned to the client.
- **Controller**: Manages the flow of data between the model and view, handling incoming API requests and processing them accordingly.

## 3. **Data Storage: AWS RDS and DynamoDB**

### Rationale
- **Amazon RDS**: Chosen for relational data storage due to its scalability, automated backups, and easy integration with other AWS services. Used for user management, project management, and structured data that requires complex queries.
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: Selected for storing diffs and AI-generated explanations because of its ability to handle large amounts of unstructured data with low latency and high scalability.

### Implementation
- **User Management and Project Management**: Data is stored in Amazon RDS, leveraging relational database capabilities for managing user accounts, permissions, and project metadata.
- **Diffs and Explanations**: Stored in DynamoDB, allowing for rapid access and flexibility in handling large, unstructured data associated with commit histories.

## 4. **Caching: Amazon ElastiCache**

### Rationale
- **Performance**: Caching frequently accessed data reduces the load on the primary database and improves response times.
- **Scalability**: Amazon ElastiCache provides a fully managed, scalable caching solution using Redis, which is ideal for storing temporary data, session management, and caching API responses.

### Implementation
- **Use Cases**: Cached data includes frequently accessed commit data, parsed diffs, and AI-generated explanations that do not need to be stored permanently.
- **Configuration**: ElastiCache is configured to manage cache eviction policies and TTL (Time to Live) settings to ensure efficient cache usage.

## 5. **File Storage: Amazon S3**

### Rationale
- **Scalability and Durability**: Amazon S3 is highly scalable and provides 99.999999999% durability, making it ideal for storing large files, backups, and any content that needs to be reliably stored and retrieved.
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: S3's tiered storage options allow for cost-effective management of data with varying access patterns.

### Implementation
- **AI Model Outputs**: AI-generated explanations, supplementary materials, and multimedia content are stored in S3. References to these objects are stored in DynamoDB or RDS.
- **Temporary Files**: Temporary files generated during processing are stored in S3, where operations are performed before final storage in S3. Lifecycle policies manage the deletion of these temporary files.

## 6. **Asynchronous Processing: Apache Kafka via Amazon MSK**

### Rationale
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Apache Kafka, managed by Amazon MSK, is used to decouple services and handle asynchronous processing, allowing the system to handle tasks like AI explanation generation without blocking the main application flow.
- **Scalability**: Kafka's ability to handle large volumes of messages and its horizontal scalability make it ideal for handling high-throughput data streams.

### Implementation
- **Commit Processing Pipeline**: As commits are processed, messages are sent to Kafka topics, which trigger actions such as diff parsing and AI explanation generation.
- **Notifications**: Kafka is also used for sending notifications about task completion or other events.

## 7. **API Management: Amazon API Gateway**

### Rationale
- **Centralized Management**: API Gateway provides a centralized point for managing, securing, and scaling APIs. It also offers features like request/response transformation, caching, and API versioning.
- **Security**: API Gateway integrates with AWS IAM and other security mechanisms to protect APIs from unauthorized access.

### Implementation
- **Routing**: API Gateway routes incoming API requests to the appropriate microservices, handling authentication, rate limiting, and monitoring.
- **Caching**: Frequently requested data can be cached at the API Gateway layer to improve performance and reduce the load on backend services.

## 8. **Monitoring and Logging: Amazon CloudWatch**

### Rationale
- **Integrated Monitoring**: Amazon CloudWatch provides comprehensive monitoring and logging for all AWS services, allowing for real-time visibility into application performance and health.
- **Alerting**: CloudWatch Alarms can be set up to trigger notifications or automated responses based on predefined thresholds.

### Implementation
- **Log Management**: Application logs from all microservices are centralized in CloudWatch Logs, where they can be queried and analyzed.
- **Metrics and Dashboards**: CloudWatch Metrics and Dashboards provide real-time insights into key performance indicators (KPIs), such as API response times, error rates, and resource utilization.

## 9. **Security: AWS IAM and Cognito**

### Rationale
- **Access Control**: AWS IAM is used to manage access to AWS resources, ensuring that only authorized users and services can interact with sensitive data and infrastructure.
- **User Authentication**: Amazon Cognito is used to manage user authentication and authorization, providing a secure and scalable solution for handling user identities.

### Implementation
- **IAM Roles and Policies**: Defined to limit access to only necessary resources, following the principle of least privilege.
- **Cognito User Pools**: Used to manage user sign-up, sign-in, and access control, integrating with API Gateway for secure API access.

## 10. **Continuous Integration and Deployment: GitHub Actions**

### Rationale
- **Automation**: GitHub Actions is used for automating the build, test, and deployment processes, ensuring that code changes are reliably integrated and deployed to production.
- **Flexibility**: GitHub Actions provides a highly customizable workflow automation tool that integrates seamlessly with the GitHub repository.

### Implementation
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Configured to automatically run tests on code commits, build Docker images, and deploy services to AWS using Terraform or AWS CLI commands.

## Conclusion

These software design choices ensure that **CommitWise** is built with scalability, maintainability, and performance in mind. By integrating industry-standard technologies and best practices, the application is well-prepared for production use and can easily evolve to meet future requirements.
