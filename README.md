## Overview

**CommitWise** is a powerful tool that allows developers to create interactive tutorials directly from a GitHub repository. This application simplifies the process of teaching and learning by enabling users to attach explanations and code sections to specific commits in a Git repository. It also supports AI-powered explanations to assist in generating detailed and understandable content.

## Features

- **Interactive Tutorials**: Create tutorials that guide users step-by-step through a Git repository.
- **Commit-Based Sections**: Link specific commits to tutorial sections, allowing users to see code changes in context.
- **AI-Assisted Explanations**: Use AI to generate explanations for the code, making it easier to understand complex logic.
- **Easy Integration**: Pass in the link to a GitHub repository, and the app will automatically fetch all the commits.
- **Customizable Content**: Write your own explanations (future features planner) or use the AI suggestions to enhance your tutorials.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Navigate through the tutorial using an intuitive interface that highlights both the code and explanations.

## Usage

1. **Open the Application**:
   Once the application is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

2. **Input the GitHub Repository URL**:
   Enter the URL of the GitHub repository you want to create a tutorial for.

3. **Fetch Commits**:
   The app will fetch all commits from the repository and display them in a timeline.

4. **Attach Explanations**:
   Select a commit to attach an explanation. You can write your own or use the AI-generated suggestion.

5. **Generate and Share**:
   After you've finished, you can export the tutorial and share it with others.
